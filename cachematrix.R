## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object 
## that stores a invertible matrix and cache's the inverse of that matrix.


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned 
## by makeCacheMatrix function. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve retrieve the inverse 
## from the cache.The assumpton that the matrix supplied is always invertible 
## is done.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
